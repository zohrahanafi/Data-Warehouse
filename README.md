# Data-Warehouse


This data warehouse project involved the transformation of an **operational** database into a **decisional** one. The objective was to propose a comprehensive design and implementation for various phases of the process. Initially, we initiated the project by designing the data warehouse using a star schema. Subsequently, we transitioned to the implementation of the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process to effectively create and populate the data warehouse.
